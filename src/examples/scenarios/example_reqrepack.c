/**
 * @brief Demonstrates the usage of a server service and how to make a request.
 *
 * To run this example, define EXAMPLE_REQREPACK and configure
 * the host and CONTROL_PUB_PORT to match your core.
 *
 * The following steps are taken in this example:
 * 1. Create an adapter and get it operational
 * 2. Register a server
 * 3. Make a request to the server
 * 4. Receive the request on the server, start a asyncron calculation
 * 5. Send an answer from the server once the calculation is done
 * 6. Receive the answer on the requestor and print it (only if ENABLE_PRINTS is
 * defined)
 * 7. Receive the automatically sended ack message on the server and clean up to be ready for the next request
 * 8. Wait 2 seconds and make a new request to the server
