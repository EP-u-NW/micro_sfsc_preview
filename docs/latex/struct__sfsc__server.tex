\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
State memory for a server service. 

To create a server, declare a sfsc\+\_\+server struct, fill it, and use the register\+\_\+service function. The sfsc\+\_\+server struct must be valid until it is unregistered by an call to the unregister\+\_\+server function.

In constrast to the creating process of a publisher, filling a server is NOT optional.

If you want to choose a service id for the server yourself, you can fill the service\+\_\+id before registration with an valid 128bit UUID in standard-\/hexgroup-\/format (see the random\+\_\+uuid for more information). Usually, you want to set this field to sfsc\+\_\+\+Sfsc\+Id\+\_\+init\+\_\+default (what it already is for any instance initalized with sfsc\+\_\+server\+\_\+\+DEFAULT\+\_\+\+INIT) and let the framework automatically generate a service id. After registration, you should not change the value of this field.

If you want to choose a topic for the server yourself you can configure the topic buffer to point to a valid topic. The topic buffer must be valid and immutable (see the sfsc\+\_\+buffer documentation for more insight on this) as long as the server is registered. If you want the framework to choose a topic for you, set this field to SERVICE\+\_\+\+TOPIC\+\_\+\+AUTOGEN (what it already is for any instance initalized with sfsc\+\_\+server\+\_\+\+DEFAULT\+\_\+\+INIT). To save memory, the framework will then simply use the service\+\_\+id as topic.

The is\+\_\+channel field indicates if this server service is a channel service. Channel services do not answer requests with normal binary payload, but answer them with publisher service definitions. Then, the adapter that made the request can subscribe to the publisher and recive values in a streamlike way. After registration, you should not change the value of this field.

The ack\+\_\+settings field describe this servers acknwoledge strategy\+: usually, if a server answers a request, the requestor will send back an acknowledge message to the server, so that the server knows that the request was succesfully served. If this acknowledge message does not reach the server after ack\+\_\+settings.\+timeout\+\_\+ms milliseconds, the server will attempt to retransmit the answer, up to ack\+\_\+settings.\+send\+\_\+max\+\_\+tries times. If ack\+\_\+settings.\+send\+\_\+max\+\_\+tries is set to 0, this server won\textquotesingle{}t wait for acknowledges and use a fire-\/and-\/forget approach. This has some beneficial implications to the answer\+\_\+request and answer\+\_\+channel\+\_\+request functions, documented there. In most cases, using a fire-\/and-\/forget approach is valid, since most transmission errors will be corrected on the tcp layer, and a performant sfsc core will rarely drop messages on the zmtp layer.

The on\+\_\+request callback is invoked every time a request for this server service is receieved. It is allowed to change the on\+\_\+request callback, even after registering th service. After receiving a request, you will usually take some actions based on the payload and eventually send an answer back to the requestor using the answer\+\_\+request or answer\+\_\+channel\+\_\+request function.

The payload buffer is only valid during the current user task micro step (see the user\+\_\+task documentation). b\+\_\+auto\+\_\+advance is an out-\/parameter (meaning that you should set it), that lets you pause the user task on the current mirco step\+: if you set it to 0, you will enter the pause state and the payload pointer will be valid, even after the callback returns. On the other hand, the user task will not advance to the next micro step until you leave the pause state manually (see advance\+\_\+user\+\_\+ring).

The expected\+\_\+reply\+\_\+id and reply\+\_\+topic are pull-\/throught parameters, meaning that you don\textquotesingle{}t need to interact with them, but pass them to the answer\+\_\+request or answer\+\_\+channel\+\_\+request once you want to answer the request. The reply\+\_\+topic is like the payload also only valid during the current user task micro step.

If you attempt to answer an request right in the callback consider the following\+: For fire-\/and-\/forget servers, this is valid, since the reply\+\_\+topic you receive by the on\+\_\+request callback will be passed to the answer\+\_\+request function, which will return before the on\+\_\+request callback returns. For non-\/fire-\/and-\/forget servers, this is not valid, since the reply\+\_\+topic must be valid till the corresonding on\+\_\+ack call, and not till the answer\+\_\+request function returns. To work arround this, you can either copy the content of the reply\+\_\+topic somewhere global (recommended) or pause the user task, until the corresonding on\+\_\+ack is invoked. Even if the user task is in pause state, the on\+\_\+ack callback of an answer\+\_\+request will be invoked, so there will be no deadlock. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
