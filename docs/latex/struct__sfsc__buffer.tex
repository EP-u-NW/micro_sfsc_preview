\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
A simple structure to store binary data and their length. 

This structure type is widely used in the framework for compact data storing. It is important to notice that some functions will take a sfsc\+\_\+buffer struct as parameter directly, while others will work with pointers. In the most cases, this says something about the mutality of the content.

In general, for the use-\/time of a sfsc\+\_\+buffer (usually defined in the respective functions documentation), the memory area the buffer points to must be valid and of the in the struct specified length.

When passing the struct to a function, it must be immutable, meaning that for the use-\/time of the sfsc\+\_\+buffer, the content must not change.

When passing a pointer to a function, the content is allowed to be mutable, meaning that during the use-\/time of the sfsc\+\_\+buffer, you are allowed to change the content pointer and thereby change the memory area are this sfsc\+\_\+buffer is backed by. If you do so, don\textquotesingle{}t forget to update the length field accordingly. 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
