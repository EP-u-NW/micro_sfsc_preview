\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
State memory for a publisher service. 

To create a publisher, declare a sfsc\+\_\+publisher struct, fill it, and use either the register\+\_\+publisher or the register\+\_\+publisher\+\_\+unregistered function. The sfsc\+\_\+publisher struct must be valid until it is unregistered by an call to the unregister\+\_\+publisher function.

Filling a publisher is optional and means to set values to the on\+\_\+subscription\+\_\+change, the service\+\_\+id and topic fields.

If you want to choose a service id for the publisher yourself, you can fill the service\+\_\+id before registration with an valid 128bit UUID in standard-\/hexgroup-\/format (see the random\+\_\+uuid for more information). Usually, you want to set this field to sfsc\+\_\+\+Sfsc\+Id\+\_\+init\+\_\+default (what it already is for any instance initalized with sfsc\+\_\+publisher\+\_\+\+DEFAULT\+\_\+\+INIT) and let the framework automatically generate a service id. After registration, you should not change the value of this field.

If you want to choose a topic for the publisher yourself you can configure the topic buffer to point to a valid topic. The topic buffer must be valid and immutable (see the sfsc\+\_\+buffer documentation for more insight on this) as long as the publisher is registered. If you want the framework to choose a topic for you, set this field to SERVICE\+\_\+\+TOPIC\+\_\+\+AUTOGEN (what it already is for any instance initalized with sfsc\+\_\+publisher\+\_\+\+DEFAULT\+\_\+\+INIT). To save memory, the framework will then simply use the service\+\_\+id as topic.

If the subscription count of a publisher changes, the on\+\_\+subscription\+\_\+change callback is invoked. The parameters of the callback indicate the old and new subscription count. They are either 0 or at maximum 1, even if there might be more subscribers, since sfsc can only tell if there is at least 1 subscriber. During execution of the callback function, the last\+\_\+subscribers and current\+\_\+subscribers fields (not callback parameters!) are unfedined. After the callback function returns, they will match the values of the parameters. In any case, they are read-\/only!

The unregistered field is set by the framework and depends on wether you registered a publisher with the register\+\_\+publisher or the register\+\_\+publisher\+\_\+unregistered function. It indicates if the publisher is registered in the cores service registry. You must not change it! 

The documentation for this struct was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
